### 13. Constructors and Destructors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Class with constructor and destructor
class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Constructor called!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructor called!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating an object invokes the constructor
    MyClass obj;

    // Destructor is called when the object goes out of scope

    return 0;
}
```

### 14. Inheritance:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class
class Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        std::cout << "Drawing a shape." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        std::cout << "Drawing a circle." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Circle myCircle;
    myCircle.draw(); // Calls the overridden draw method in Circle

    return 0;
}
```

### 15. Exception Handling:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        // Code that might throw an exception
        int result = 10 / 0;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception caught: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

These advanced topics provide a more comprehensive understanding of C++ programming. As you continue your learning journey, explore the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) for containers (like vectors and maps) and algorithms. Don't forget to practice writing code and working on projects to solidify your understanding.
